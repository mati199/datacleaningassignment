### This is an explanation of variables in my code

I have named all the data frames the same names as the respective files in the provided data.

Aditionally i use the following:

`df_test` the merge of all test data

`df_train` the merge of all training data

`df_final` the merge of all test and train data into one data set

`mean_std_cols` a vector of indeces indicating where a column name contains mean() or std()

`mean_std_data` is the complete dataframe with the non mean and std columns removed

`mean_std_col_means` the complete dataframe with the column means calculated
